  "description": "Covey.Town provides a virtual meeting space where different groups of people can have simultaneous video calls, allowing participants to drift between different conversations, just like in real life. Covey.Town was built for Northeastern's [Spring 2021 software engineering course](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-CS5500-Spring-2021/), and is designed to be reused across semesters. You can view our reference deployment of the app at [app.covey.town](https://app.covey.town/) - this is the version that students built on, and our [project showcase](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-CS5500-Spring-2021/project-showcase) highlights select projects from Spring 2021.",
